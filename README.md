# Python Portfolio 🐍
## Welcome to my Python data analysis portfolio 👋
This repository contains my personal projects exploring data analysis using **Python**
### Objectives 🎯
- Data Loading & Cleaning 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understanding dataset structure and distributions
- Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies
- Comparing metrics across categories and time
### Setup 🛠️
#### Step 1: Install Python
<img width="1919" height="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c544f1a8-e865-43dc-9649-75c480cd1f2f" />
You can easily download and install it from the official website. This is basically the main programming language used to run all analysis in this repository.

What it does:
- Executes Python scripts
-  Runs data analysis code
-  Allows usage of data libraries such as pandas and NumPy

#### Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

This is where you can write and run the scripts, there are all sorts of code editor out there, such as PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook , etc. but I personally prefer VSCode cause it requires less RAM than full-fledge IDEs like JetBrains products.

#### Step 3: Install Required Libraries
This project mainly uses NumPy and pandas. Numpy is a numerical computing library that powers pandas internall. You can do it by copying this to the Terminal

`python -m pip install pandas`

### Projects 📂
1. NYC Citywide Payroll Data 💸
**Description**

This project analyzes the NYC Citywide Payroll dataset to explore payroll distribution across agencies, job titles, and fiscal years. The dataset contains over 2 million records, making it suitable for practicing large-scale data cleaning and analysis using Python.

Key Analysis Performed

- Cleaning salary fields stored as text with currency symbols
- Creating a Total Pay metric from multiple payroll components
- Identifying high-paying agencies and job titles
- Analyzing overtime dependency across agencies
- Exploring payroll trends over time
